# Archived Repository
This repository contains a Sniperbot implementation for the Raydium AMM on Solana, which was originally powered by Jito's mempool and bundling services.

As of March 2024, [Jito Labs has discontinued their mempool functionality](https://www.binance.com/sk/square/post/2024-03-11-solana-mev-startup-jito-labs-suspends-mempool-functionality-amid-sandwich-attacks-5268909341538) and transaction frontrunning support, rendering this bot non-functional. While this project is no longer actively maintained, it is being shared as educational material to demonstrate MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) concepts on Solana.
